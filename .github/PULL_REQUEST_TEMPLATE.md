## Maintainer merge gate

- [ ] The change has completed code review.
- [ ] Review conversations are resolved.
- [ ] The current base SHA and reviewed pull request head SHA have been recorded.
- [ ] The integration commit has exactly two parents: the recorded base, then the recorded head.
- [ ] The exact-integration status defined in the [central CI contract](https://github.com/kuasar-sandbox/kuasar-sandbox/blob/main/docs/ci.md) is `success` on that integration SHA.
- [ ] The exact-head status points to a completed, successful `pull_request_target` integration-test run.
- [ ] A final query confirmed that the base, head, and integration SHA are unchanged and the exact-head status still succeeds for the recorded run.
- [ ] The pull request will be squash merged manually; auto-merge is not used.
